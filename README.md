A few extra factions for Spring:1944
Currently includes Italy and Japan. When all the units are given proper models and properly textured, this is likely to be merged with main S44.
=======
Spring: 1944
==========

A real-time strategy game using the Spring engine, set in the final days of WWII. Think of it as a cross between Supreme Commander and Company of Heroes, designed by someone who played neither. 

If you just want to play, we suggest using the stable release, available on our [downloads page](http://spring1944.net/?page_id=124). Windows users, make sure to install [Spring](http://springrts.com) first. Once installed, fire up the lobby and `/join #s44`.


Developing: first install Spring. Then, in your Spring data directory (`~/.spring/` or `Documents & Settings/Games/Spring`), clone this repo into `games/S44Main.sdd`. Hack away!
