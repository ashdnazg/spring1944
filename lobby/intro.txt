Tons of infantry, tanks, artillery guns and more await your command. Take up arms under the Stars & Stripes, Iron Cross, Hammer & Sickle, or Union Jack, then command your troops to brutal victory. Hundreds of units, custom maps, deep and fast-paced real-time-strategy play. The scale? Epic. The gameplay? Intense. The cost? Zero - Spring: 1944 is not a "mod" of a commercial effort, but a from-scratch game developed using the open source Spring Engine. In terms of other modern RTS - Spring: 1944 is the golden mean between Supreme Commander and Company of Heroes.
