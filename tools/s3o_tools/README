Muon's s3o-tools https://github.com/Muon/s3o-tools

These are some basic tools for manipulating S3O files in Python.
Scripts and modules have been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3, but
should be compatible with Python >=2.6.
More will be added later.

s3o.py          - S3O parsing and serialization module
s3o-optimize.py	- strips redundant data, reindexes and performs vertex
                  cache optimization on S3O meshes
