-General-
*Disabling units not meant to be included in next release (Churchill, Tiger, KV-1, M10, Achilles, ISU-152).
*Bumping up brakerates for all tracked vehicles to 0.45 (from 0.25).

-Balance/Gameplay changes-
-Big-
*Removed Observation infantry, replaced them with a "Scout" with a small LoS. Also nerfed Sniper LoS significantly.
*Units that cloak while moving move rather slower.
This removes the "observ shielding" gameplay that was a problem.
It is much easier to manuever forces around enemy concentrations now that enemy LoS doesn't cover half the map.
*Equalized Riflemen ranges (In decending order of range: Britain - 810, Germany - 805, Soviets - 800, US - 785).
*Increased Garand rate of fire by 10%.
*Nerfed Soviet infantry HP to 40 (from 50), Partisans to 20 (from 25).

-Small-
*Cheapened trucks to 100m each
*Sniper rifle range greatly increased (+50%)
*Bringing down mobile MG cost for all but soviets (450m-->300m).
*Cheapened Leig/Packhow (from ~2000 to 1100, 1200m respectively).
*Lowering cost of APC halftracks by half (from ~1000 to 500).
*Lowering cost of ZiS-3, along with a range nerf (now that its not serving as mid-range arty as much, it can be more of a direct fire gun).
*Cheapened Stuart (2700->2500) and T-70 (2850->2750).
*Doubled mortar weapon reload time, keeping suppression weapon the same (they're less effective at killing now, mainly a pinning weapon)

-New units-
*Added ML-30 Howitzer for Soviets. (This is their "heavy" arty for the lite release)
*Added Dug-in AT Guns for all sides (directional + limited arc like the MGs - higher cost and HP than normal towed AT guns)
*Added Kangaroo Armored Infantry Transport - with only slightly less armor than a Sherman tank, this
 transport allows British infantry to get past light defenses that would stop halftracks or trucks instantly.

-Bugfixes-
*Fixing mortars exploding in mid-air in SVN Spring.
*Fixing weaponID on ML-30 suppresssion weapon.
*Removing XP widget for now (until we have our own images) - fixes giant white squares
*Fixed HE shells and MGs damaging flags
*Removed +3 metal production from US veh yard.
*Removed a no-effect script error in mortars, sdkfz9 (double semicolon).

--JAN 2nd, 2008 (SVN REV 773)--
*brought rifle ranges on average back up to 900 (maintained differences, just not to the extreme that they were)
*fixed russian truck costing 400m.
*fixed flags being used by AIs for energy
*fixed SMG/rifle movecloak. 
*removed MG from german bunker
*added new FX for 20mm
*fixed ML-30 lacking an armor.txt entry
*bumped AP mine cost back up a touch since there are basically no counters to it atm (except tanks)
*bumped up bazooka/PIAT/RPG-43 damage to 8500, 'faust to 5500
*changed the weaponID on a few of the bigger arty pieces so they don't get read as AP weapons.

--JAN 8th, 2008 (SVN 793)--
*Added completed Tiger w/ skin and all (can not yet be built)
*Removed ALL Lua to deal with crashes (LuaUI and widgets still crashed) - better safe then sorry
*Gave German HQ Bunker its MGs back
*Animated cursors
*Fixed Partisan and Rifle/SMG move-while-cloaked

--JAN 9th, 2008 (SVN 818)--
*Removed all LuaUI widgets except Team Circle, Build ETA and Custom Formations, which have all been made to disabled by default
*If crashes still occur, please disable all unecessary widgets and report the problem at our website
